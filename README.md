# TeamProfileGenerator
MSU - Homework 10: Team Profile Generator (Node)

## Overview
For this project I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a nicely formatted software engineer team roster based on inforamtion provided by the user.
The user can input any number of team members, such as, engineers and interns. Once the user has answered the prompts, the application will create an HTML file (team.html) that displays a nicely formatted roster.

The application can be invoked with the following command:
```
node index.js
```
